# Blog Platform API

## Description
The Blog Platform API is a RESTful API that allows users to manage blog posts, including writing, editing, and commenting on them. The system stores each post in a database, including its text content, associated tags, and author details. The application provides a set of RESTful API endpoints for managing the blog posts and is deployable in a live environment.
